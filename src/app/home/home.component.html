      <h1>Art Theme: Mono-no-aware</h1>
      <h4><i>"The Pathos of Things"</i></h4>
      <p>This years theme is "Mono no aware", a Japanese idiom for the awareness of impermanence, or transience of
        things. The artist should reflect on the greater concept of life and may express through their work the
        beauty, sadness, or greater emotions that arise from this reflection. Submissions can be in any style of
        your choosing.</p>
